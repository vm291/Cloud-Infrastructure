Conclusion: 
Docker is more efficient than a Virtual Machine as:
-it uses less memory (1.72GB vs. ~6GB).
-uses less CPU power (101.95% vs. 228.1%).
-has faster execution, and
-better sclsbility

VM should be used when OS isolation is needed or when running multiple OS versions or when security and process isolation are top priorities. 
But for performance, speed and efficiency Docker is better.
